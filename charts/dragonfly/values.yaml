containerRuntime:
  # -- [Experimental] Support docker, when use docker-shim in Kubernetes, please set containerRuntime.docker.enable to true.
  # For supporting docker, we need generate CA and update certs, then hijack registries traffic,
  # By default, it's unnecessary to restart docker daemon when pull image from private registries,
  # this feature is support explicit registries in containerRuntime.registry.domains, default domains is ghcr.io, quay.io,
  # please update your registries by `--set containerRuntime.registry.domains='{harbor.example.com,harbor.example.net}' --set containerRuntime.registry.injectHosts=true --set containerRuntime.docker.enable=true`.
  # Caution:
  #   **We did not recommend to using dragonfly with docker in Kubernetes** due to many reasons: 1. no fallback image pulling policy. 2. deprecated in Kubernetes.
  #   Because the original `daemonset` in Kubernetes did not support `Surging Rolling Update` policy.
  #   When kill current dfdaemon pod, the new pod image can not be pulled anymore.
  #   If you can not change runtime from docker to others, remind to choose a plan when upgrade dfdaemon:
  #     Option 1: pull newly dfdaemon image manually before upgrade dragonfly, or use [ImagePullJob](https://openkruise.io/docs/user-manuals/imagepulljob) to pull image automate.
  #     Option 2: keep the image registry of dragonfly is different from common registries and add host in `containerRuntime.docker.skipHosts`.
  # Caution: docker hub image is not supported without restart docker daemon.
  # When need pull image from docker hub or any other registries not in containerRuntime.registry.domains, set containerRuntime.docker.restart=true
  # this feature will inject proxy config into docker.service and restart docker daemon.
  # Caution: set restart to true only when live restore is enable.
  # Requirement: Docker Engine v1.2.0+ without Rootless.
