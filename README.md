Helm charts for Dragonfly.

## Introduction

Dragonfly is an open source intelligent P2P based image and file distribution system. Its goal is to tackle all distribution problems in cloud native scenarios. Currently Dragonfly focuses on being:

- Simple: well-defined user-facing API (HTTP), non-invasive to all container engines;
- Efficient: Seed peer support, P2P based file distribution to save enterprise bandwidth;
- Intelligent: host level speed limit, intelligent flow control due to host detection;
- Secure: block transmission encryption, HTTPS connection support.

Dragonfly is now hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as an Incubating Level Project. Originally it was born to solve all kinds of distribution at very large scales, such as application distribution, cache distribution, log distribution, image distribution, and so on.
